# Contact Book Application

## Introduction

The Contact Book application is a simple desktop program to manage contact information, including names, phone numbers, and email addresses. This application demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns in Python.

### How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the repository folder.
4. Run the application using the command:
    ```sh
    python contact_book.py
    ```

### How to Use the Program

- **Add Contact**: Enter the contact details in the form fields and click the "Add Contact" button.
- **Edit Contact**: Select a contact from the list and click "Edit Contact" to modify the details.
- **Delete Contact**: Select a contact from the list and click "Delete Contact" to remove the contact.
- **Copy Contact**: Select a contact from the list and click "Copy Contact" to copy the contact details to the clipboard.
- **Search Contacts**: Enter a search query in the search bar to filter contacts.

## Body/Analysis

### Object-Oriented Programming Pillars

#### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. In this program, the `Contact` class encapsulates the contact details.

```python
class Contact:
    def __init__(self, name, country_code, phone, email):
        self.name = name
        self.country_code = country_code
        self.phone = phone
        self.email = email
```

#### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. The `ContactFactory` class provides a simple interface to create `Contact` objects.

```python
class ContactFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_contact(name, country_code, phone, email):
        return Contact(name, country_code, phone, email)
```

#### Inheritance

Inheritance is not directly used in this simple application, but it could be implemented if we had different types of contacts that share common properties and behaviors.

#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. In this application, we don't have a direct use case for polymorphism, but it can be easily implemented with additional functionality like different types of contact methods.

### Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is used in the `ContactBookApp` class to ensure only one instance of the application exists.

```python
class ContactBookApp:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

#### Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Here, `ContactFactory` is used to create `Contact` objects.

```python
class ContactFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_contact(name, country_code, phone, email):
        return Contact(name, country_code, phone, email)
```

### File Operations

The program reads from and writes to a JSON file to persist the contact data. This allows the application to save the state and reload it on the next run.

#### Saving Contacts

```python
def save_contacts(self):
    contacts_data = [{"name": c.name, "country_code": c.country_code, "phone": c.phone, "email": c.email} for c in self.contacts]
    with open("contacts.json", "w") as file:
        json.dump(contacts_data, file)
```

#### Loading Contacts

```python
def load_contacts(self):
    if os.path.exists("contacts.json"):
        with open("contacts.json", "r") as file:
            contacts_data = json.load(file)
            for contact_data in contacts_data:
                contact = Contact(contact_data["name"], contact_data["country_code"], contact_data["phone"], contact_data["email"])
                self.contacts.append(contact)
        self.update_contact_listbox()
```

## Results and Summary

### Results

- Successfully implemented a contact book application using OOP principles.
- Implemented Singleton and Factory Method design patterns.
- Enabled persistent storage using JSON file read/write operations.

### Conclusions

- The application demonstrates the effective use of OOP principles and design patterns in Python.
- The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the application runs at a time.
- The Factory Method pattern simplifies the creation of contact objects.
- Future improvements could include additional contact management features, such as different contact types and enhanced search functionality.

### Future Prospects

- Extend the application to handle different types of contacts (e.g., personal, business).
- Implement polymorphism to handle various contact-related behaviors.
- Add additional data validation and error handling.
- Enhance the user interface for better usability.
